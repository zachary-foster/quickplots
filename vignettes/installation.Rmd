Since `quickplots` is not on CRAN , it has to be installed from its GitHub repository. There is a function to do this called
`install_github` in the `devtools` package. 

If you do not have the `devtools` package already installed, you can install it by entering:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
```

Once you have `devtools` installed, you can install `quickplots` using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = "zachary-foster/quickplots")
```

`quickplots` has some dependencies, including:

- ggplot2
- boot
- plyr
- grid


These should be installed automatically with `quickplots` if you do not already have them. If this does not happen, 
you might have to install them yourself.

Description: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. This package is intended to be a
    collection of plotting functions that each are designed to work with some
    combination of variable types (e.g. quantitative, categorical, binary). The
    names of functions should reflect this so it should be unnecessary to
    memorize all the function names.
